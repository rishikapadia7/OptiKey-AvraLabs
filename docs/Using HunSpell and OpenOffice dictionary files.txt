1.Download HunSpell from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ - e.g. https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/hunspell-1.3.2-3-w32-bin.zip/download
	This gives you munch.exe/unmunch.exe in the bin directory.

2a.Dictionaries can be downloaded from here: http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/search?f[0]=field_project_tags%3A157 - e.g. http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/hellenic-greek-dictionary-spell-check-and-hyphenation
	This gives you an .oxt file - open it as an archive (using 7zip for example) and extract the culture code .dic and .aff files.

2b.Alternatively you can download (what seem to be) the same Hunspell compatible dictionaries from SoftMaker here: http://www.softmaker.com/en/download/dictionaries

3.Unmunch them: unmunch el-GR.dic el-GR.aff >> el-GR.unmunched

4.Open and inspect the unmunched file. N.B. you may have to manually open the file using the correct encoding and resave as UTF-8. Greek, for example, is gibberish when you first open the unmunched file in Sublime Text, but re-opening using "Greek Windows" encoding solves that problem.

5.The dictionary files can be massive, so further filtering can be performed by then extracting only entries in the frequency word lists: https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/
